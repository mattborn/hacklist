# Hacklist Project

## Architecture
- Manage root-level files separately from project directories
- Use copy operations (not moves) to sync files between root and hacklist/
- Avoid git submodule complexity by maintaining files in both locations
- Root files (index.html, styles.css, etc.) should work in both root and hacklist/

## Dependencies
- cards.json must exist in parent directory
- Files must be dug from hacklist/ directory first using CLI
- cards.json is generated by the cardify project (separate repository)

## Managed Files
- index.html
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- .prettierrc.js
- hacklist.js (CLI tool)
## CLI Usage
- cards.json must exist in parent directory (generated by cardify project)
- CLI tool should never copy/move itself
- Must run CLI from parent directory using full path to script
- Only 'dig' command is needed - 'bury' command was only used during initial project setup
```bash
# Copy files from hacklist/ to parent directory (override)
node hacklist/dig.js
- README.md
# Copy files from hacklist/ to parent directory (override)
node hacklist/dig.js
```
