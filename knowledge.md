# Hacklist Project

## Architecture

- Manage root-level files separately from project directories
- Use copy operations (not moves) to sync files between root and hacklist/
- Avoid git submodule complexity by maintaining files in both locations
- Root files (index.html, styles.css, etc.) should work in both root and hacklist/

## Dependencies

- cards.json must exist in parent directory
- Files must be dug from hacklist/ directory first using CLI
- cards.json is generated by the cardify project (separate repository)
- .prettierrc.js must be applied to all files (run `npx prettier --write .` before committing)

## File Organization
- styles.css and scripts.js remain in hacklist/ directory
- index.html sources these files from hacklist/ directory
- CLI tool (dig.js) should never copy/move itself
- Root directory stays clean except for essential files

## Style Preferences

- Use .prettierrc.js settings for all file modifications
- Ensure editor is configured to format on save using project's Prettier config
- Maintain consistent spacing and quotes across all files

## Managed Files

- index.html
- styles.css
- scripts.js
- .prettierrc.js
- hacklist.js (CLI tool)## Design Patterns
- Use CSS variables for theming (especially dark mode support)
- Cards should be displayed in a flex-wrapped grid
- Each card links to its project's relative path
- Tag-based filtering should be available via tabs
- Reference: neverbeforeseen.group layout structure
- Use rem units for consistent scaling (10rem h1, 3rem lede)
- Full-width layout with 6rem padding
- Cards flex basis of 15rem with 3rem gap

## Anti-patterns

- Don't make hasty style changes without understanding layout principles
- Spacing between flex items is controlled by gap property, not margins
- Avoid overriding flexbox behavior with unnecessary margin/padding adjustments
- When using negative margins with flexbox gap, increase the gap to compensate for the overlap

## CLI Usage

- cards.json must exist in parent directory (generated by cardify project)
- CLI tool should never copy/move itself
- Must run CLI from parent directory using full path to script
- Only 'dig' command is needed - 'bury' command was only used during initial project setup

```bash
# Copy files from hacklist/ to parent directory (override)
node hacklist/dig.js
- README.md
# Copy files from hacklist/ to parent directory (override)
node hacklist/dig.js
```
