# Project Organization

## Current Challenge

- Many projects in Code/ folder making it hard to track active vs archived projects
- Need clearer organization for active development

## Proposed Structure

1. Move active projects to Demo/ directory
2. Create index project to navigate between active projects
3. Keep archived projects in Code/ for reference

## Next Steps

- [ ] Identify active projects to move
- [ ] Create index project with previews/links
- [ ] Set up quick navigation between projects

## Prerequisites

- Run `node hacklist/dig` to get latest files from hacklist/
- Ensure cards.json exists in parent directory (generated by cardify project)

## Benefits

- Clearer separation between active and archived work
- Easier to focus on current projects
- Better visibility into work in progress

## Index Project Ideas

- Simple grid of project previews
- Quick links to jump between projects
- Basic status indicators (active/paused)
- Last updated timestamps
- Tech stack tags
